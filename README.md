# Project Goals
The goal of this project is to predict the number of ion channels open at a given time. Researchers deployed this Kaggle competition to find machine learning techniques that will accurately predict the number of open channels. Experimentally, the signals from open channels are found using patch clamp technology, which slowly measures signals from ion channels.

# Data Source
This capstone project a competition from Kaggle. I downloaded the data from Kaggle.com, Univerisity of Liverpool-Ion Channels competition. The data did not have any NaN values; however, the data was recorded in 50 second intervals as described in the article detailing the experiment. 

# Method
The data science method as outlined in ion.ipynb is download the data, explore the data, build baseline model, remove noise from signal data for further models, model the data and predict the number of open channels. Finally, calculate the F1 score of the predicted open channels. The F1 score is calculated using precsion (P) and recall-sensitivity (R) and defined as follows:
                                         F1 Score= \frac{2*Precision*Recall}{Precision+Recall}

# Importance of Ion Channels
Ion channels are pores along proteins that are essential in various biological processes. The understanding of ion channels is important biotech applications, neuroscience, cardiac physiology, and neural communication such as encode learning and memory. The following notebook offers an excellent visual overview of ion channels: https://www.kaggle.com/mobassir/understanding-ion-switching-with-modeling?scriptVersionId=32647837

# Models
Xgboost and Stumpy? (include sources)

# Scores and Conclusion

# Future Work
Thisi is will most likely be the end of this project, but I do plan on pursuing other biological applicable data science projects.
